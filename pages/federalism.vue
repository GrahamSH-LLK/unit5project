      Federalism is a system of government that allows a territory to be
      controlled by different levels of government. In the US, there are three
      levels of government in any given territory. The highest, and most
      powerful is the federal government. The next level is the State
      government. The last, and least powerful level of government is local
      government.

      in the US. You'll also have a great time driving on our roads, a split
      power of federal and state governments. If you get in trouble, you'll get
      a great trial in our state courts. Although establishing courts is a split
      power, our state courts are our responsibility that we take seriously.
