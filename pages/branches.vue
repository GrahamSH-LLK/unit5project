      Massachusetts has three branches of government that will make your stay
      here amazing. The first branch is the Executive branch. It is in charge of
      enforcing laws in both the Massachusetts and US governments. It contains
      the chief Executive and their cabinet in both systems. Next is the
      Legislative branch, in charge of making laws. It contains the Senate and
      House of Representatives. Lastly is the Judicial branch. It is tasked with
      interpreting laws and deciding court cases. It contains the court systems.
      The Executive branch is somewhat different between the 2 forms of
      government. They both have a chief Executive and a Vice Chief Executive.
      They also contain the Chief Executive's cabinet. In Massachusetts, we also
      have a council to confirm certain groups. The chief/vice chief executives
      are also picked differently. In the US, we use the electoral college, but
      in Massachusetts, we have a direct election.
